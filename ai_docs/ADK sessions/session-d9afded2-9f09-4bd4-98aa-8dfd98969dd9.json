    "investigation_summary": "# Investigation Summary: Anthropic AI\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis investigation provides a comprehensive overview of Anthropic AI, an American artificial intelligence startup established in 2021. The company was founded by former OpenAI employees, including siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, who departed due to differing views on AI safety and development direction [1, 2, 3]. Anthropic operates as a public-benefit corporation, with a stated mission to develop AI systems that are safe, reliable, interpretable, and beneficial to humanity. This commitment to safety is a core aspect of its corporate identity and research focus [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11].\n\nAnthropic has secured its position as a major player in the AI landscape through significant financial backing from major tech companies, including investments of up to $4 billion from Amazon and $2 billion from Google [1, 2, 3]. The company's primary products are the Claude chatbot and its family of large language models (LLMs), which include tiers such as Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku, each designed for varying levels of complexity and computational efficiency [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11]. To further its mission, Anthropic actively engages in AI safety research and has launched initiatives like \"Labs\" for incubating experimental products and the \"Economic Index\" to measure the real-world impact of its technology [5, 9, 10, 11].\n\n## Key Findings\n1.  **Founding and Mission:** Anthropic AI was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI staff who left over disagreements regarding AI safety. It is structured as a public-benefit corporation dedicated to building safe, reliable, and beneficial AI. - **VERIFIED** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11]\n2.  **Core Products:** The company's main offerings are the Claude chatbot and its associated family of large language models (LLMs), including the Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku models, which cater to different performance and resource requirements. - **VERIFIED** [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11]\n3.  **Significant Funding:** Anthropic has attracted substantial capital, most notably from Amazon, which has committed up to $4 billion, and Google, which has invested $2 billion. - **VERIFIED** [1, 2, 3]\n4.  **Research and Development:** The company actively pursues AI safety research and has established programs like \"Labs\" to foster experimental product development and the \"Economic Index\" to track the societal impact of its models. - **VERIFIED** [5, 9, 10, 11]\n\n## Verified Claims\n1.  **\"Anthropic AI is an American artificial intelligence (AI) startup founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees (including Dario and Daniela Amodei) who left due to differing views on AI development and safety.\"**\n    - **Evidence:** Multiple sources confirm that Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees, including the Amodei siblings, who departed due to disagreements over the company's direction on AI safety.\n2.  **\"Anthropic operates as a public-benefit corporation with a core mission to ensure the development of AI systems that are safe, reliable, interpretable, and beneficial to humanity.\"**\n    - **Evidence:** The company's own website and multiple articles state that Anthropic is a public-benefit corporation dedicated to building safe, reliable, and interpretable AI systems for the benefit of humanity.\n3.  **\"Anthropic's primary products are the Claude chatbot and its family of large language models (LLMs), including versions like Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku, each tailored for different needs and computational power.\"**\n    - **Evidence:** Sources consistently identify the Claude chatbot and its corresponding LLMs (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) as Anthropic's main product offerings, detailing the different capabilities and intended uses for each model.\n4.  **\"Anthropic has raised substantial funding, including significant investments from major investors like Amazon (up to $4 billion) and Google ($2 billion).\"**\n    - **Evidence:** News articles and financial reports from reputable sources confirm the significant investments made by both Amazon and Google, citing the specific figures of up to $4 billion and $2 billion, respectively.\n5.  **\"Anthropic actively conducts research on AI safety, opportunities, and risks, and implements initiatives like 'Labs' to incubate experimental products and the 'Economic Index' to track the impact of its Claude models.\"**\n    - **Evidence:** Anthropic's official website details its research focus on AI safety and introduces initiatives such as \"Labs\" for product incubation and the \"Economic Index\" to measure the real-world impact of its technology.\n\n## Unverified/Disputed Claims\nAll claims extracted during this investigation were successfully verified against the available sources. No unverified or disputed claims were identified.\n\n## Bias Assessment\nOverall bias score: 3.5/10 (Slight Bias)\nThe investigation utilized a mix of sources, including neutral encyclopedic entries, tech news blogs, and official company-owned channels (website, LinkedIn, X account, research papers). While the majority of sources were rated as having a \"Slight Bias\" (3-4/10), this is largely due to the inherent self-promotional nature of corporate communications. These sources, while presenting a positive view of the company, provided factual information about product launches, mission statements, and initiatives. The inclusion of a neutral Wikipedia source (1/10) helped balance the perspective. Overall, the coverage provides a well-rounded view based on publicly available information.\n\n## Timeline\n| Date | Event |\n|---|---|\n| 2020 | Former OpenAI employees (including Dario and Daniela Amodei) left OpenAI due to differing views on AI development and safety.

Its mission is to ensure the development of AI systems that are safe, reliable, and beneficial to humanity.\n\n### Anthropic’s Funding and Notable Investors\n\n**Anthropic has raised a substantial $7.3 billion to date through several funding rounds—all within a single year.**The most notable investments include $124.62 million in Series A, $981.5 million in Series B, $446.34 million in Series C, $2 billion in Series D-1, and $3.54 billion in Series D-2 and D-3. Major investors include Amazon and Google, with Amazon alone committing up to $4 billion.\n\nGet the latest\n\nAI agent news\n\nJoin Voiceflow CEO, Braden Ream, as he explores the future of agentic tech in business on the Humans Talking Agents podcast.\n\n[Listen Now](https://www.voiceflow.com/podcasts/humans-talking-agents?p=podcastcta)\n\n![Image 2: Humans Talking Agents podcast cover](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/656f60dc2d85b496beec7c35/68ffccd8d41236257528bc07_hta_cover.png)\n\nWhat Does Anthropic AI Do?\n--------------------------\n\nAnthropic AI offers advanced AI products, primarily focused on large language models under the “Claude” brand.\n\nAnthropic also announced that two more models in the 3.5 family are planned for release later in 2024: Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3.5 Opus.\n\n### Anthropic AI’s Claude Pricing\n\n![Image 3](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657639ebfb91510f45654149/67cef0f7d6ebd0d81121f85a_667f3b32046c78b56b751f06_AD_4nXcsxa2mqs-dXSDRlNSpv3pHeynRKh1QkYVPR1Gb-aZzkCni8OuOGCxA0df5_buAeujpqfAE6tdiKXr1TzZk6RP3ftyQ0fWjESJ9swlz8URhfiU52146Hfoj3DIKlUKjvGHQu1KW9IGpkADqdMMAaaU-mYVE.webp)\n\nAnthropic AI’s Claude is free of charge with limited usage (30 messages) but requires an email address and a phone number to sign up. If you want to access Anthropic’s faster and more intelligent models, you can upgrade to Claude Pro for $20/month.\n\n### What Are the Main Differences Between Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus?\n\n![Image 4](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657639ebfb91510f45654149/67cef0f7d6ebd0d81121f860_667f3b326faf18092a3d733c_AD_4nXeNoIB8qiQy98_GWHwDQL7km8G5bJLcH0PeoSBjklT3rflyBqzNhinmYLkjQX5FC-6icGW-dKVs062OJKWOB9gnhAHS_8oxWactADd5uAyEiIRipQn1mJH6Lzs_3jf5EPN2Ph3MR73OYr6pr2MOm6tT08Ax.webp)\n\n**The Claude 3 AI models by Anthropic come in three versions: Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku, each designed for different needs.**In summary, Opus is the most powerful, excelling in complex tasks like advanced math and coding, but it requires more computational power. Sonnet strikes a balance between performance and efficiency, making it great for general use without being too resource-heavy. Haiku is the smallest and most efficient, ideal for simpler tasks where speed and resource savings are key.\n\n*   **Claude 3 Opus**: Performs exceptionally well in Undergraduate Level Knowledge (86.8%), Grade School Math (95.0%), Multilingual Math (90.7%), and Code (84.9%). **_Best for_**_: Complex tasks requiring high reasoning, knowledge, and problem-solving skills.

Founded by former OpenAI employees, it focuses on building reliable, steerable AI systems guided by the principles of constitutional AI and long-term alignment.\n\n[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)is an [artificial intelligence](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence) research and development company founded in 2021. Its stated goal is to responsibly advance the field of [generative AI](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai), deploying safe and reliable [AI models](https://builtin.com/articles/ai-models) for public use. Anthropic’s flagship products include a chatbot and a family of [large language models](https://builtin.com/articles/large-language-models-llm) (LLMs), both named [Claude](https://builtin.com/articles/claude-ai).\n\nWhat Is Anthropic?\n------------------\n\nAnthropic is an artificial intelligence company that makes the AI chatbot Claude. It also conducts artificial intelligence research and development with a particular focus on safety and interpretability.\n\nWith substantial backing from tech giants like [Google](https://www.builtinsf.com/2023/03/13/san-francisco-tech-news-031323) and [Amazon](https://www.builtinsf.com/2023/09/25/amazon-invests-4b-anthropic) — and a valuation reaching [$183 billion](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation) — Anthropic has emerged as an industry leader when it comes to [AI safety](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-safety), and plays a key role in shaping [AI policy](https://builtin.com/articles/we-need-ai-governance) in the United States. Its top LLM is also widely considered to be among the [most capable](https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-claude-3-5-sonnet-surges-to-top-of-ai-rankings-challenging-industry-giants/) on the market.\n\nWhat Is Anthropic?\n------------------\n\nAnthropic is an AI research and development startup known for its Claude [chatbot](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-a-chatbot) and LLMs. The company also focuses on safety and [ethics](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ethics), encouraging [responsible](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-responsible-ai) innovation across the artificial intelligence industry.\n\n“Anthropic is about a purpose-driven usage of technology,” Chris Dessi, tech founder and author of [_ChatGPT for Profit: A Beginner’s Guide to Leveraging AI in Business_](https://www.amazon.com/ChatGPT-Profit-Ultimate-Beginners-Leveraging-ebook/dp/B0CYNQ5C8S), told Built In. “OpenAI brought AI to the masses, and Anthropic is making it a little bit more responsible.”\n\nTo that end, Anthropic studies and develops some of the most powerful AI systems in the world — right alongside competitors like [Google](https://builtin.com/articles/google-gemini), [OpenAI](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-chatgpt) and Microsoft — but in a more deliberate manner. While other companies rush to put out AI products as fast as they can, Anthropic chooses not to release models above certain capability thresholds until it can develop sufficiently [robust safety measures](https://www.anthropic.com/news/core-views-on-ai-safety).\n\n“Anthropic truly is a different animal altogether,” ​​Mike Finley, CTO generative AI analytics company [AnswerRocket](https://answerrocket.com/) told Built In. “They’re willing to hold off, they’re willing to hold back.”\n\nMore Anthropic Coverage[Alignment Faking: When AI Models Deceive Their Creators](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/alignment-faking)\n\nHistory of Anthropic\n--------------------\n\nAnthropic was founded in 2021 by siblings and former OpenAI executives Dario Amodei and Daniela Amodei. Along with five other colleagues, they left OpenAI in 2020 [due to](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-ceo-says-why-quit-194409797.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAH2A_Km6BNsNDCw_hIDCGKrJ5D0BMBrAZ59z9DssV3NF1A4jqAdThM8AmpwpCEJlxEPr27t_R4bSdIOY3ZN68XXxnGNgUwDg88HNTF2GMVD-FCJThDIViOq2ASKOW1tL7e0Ot7Fe4ZD5siwLWvdhEqvgp6JTaCn46lR-nrdj7r-W) concerns over OpenAI’s lack of [commitment to safety](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/balancing-innovation-compliance-ai). They launched Anthropic as a public benefit corporation, which is legally required to prioritize generating a positive social impact over profit. For Anthropic, this means building “reliable, interpretable and steerable AI systems” and conducting “frontier research” on AI safety, according to its [mission statement](https://www.anthropic.com/company).\n\nWhat Does Anthropic Do?\n-----------------------\n\nAs an AI research and development company, Anthropic not"

Building product experiences around these emerging capabilities requires different motions working in partnership: tinkering and experimenting at the edge of what Claude can do, testing unpolished versions with early users to find what works, and taking what lands and scaling it into products our customers can rely on.\n\nThis approach has produced Claude Code, which grew from a research preview to a [billion-dollar product](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone) in six months; the Model Context Protocol (MCP) which, at [100M monthly downloads](https://www.anthropic.com/news/donating-the-model-context-protocol-and-establishing-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation), has become the industry standard for connecting AI to tools and data; [Skills](https://claude.com/blog/skills), [Claude in Chrome](https://www.claude.com/blog/claude-for-chrome), and [Cowork](https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview), which launched as a research preview yesterday to bring Claude’s agentic capabilities to desktop.\n\nToday we’re building on this approach with the expansion of Labs, a team focused on incubating experimental products at the frontier of Claude’s capabilities. Mike Krieger—who co-founded Instagram and has spent the past two years as Anthropic’s Chief Product Officer—is joining Labs to build alongside Ben Mann. Ami Vora—who joined Anthropic at the end of 2025—will lead the Product organization, partnering closely with Rahul Patil, our CTO, to scale the Claude experiences that millions of users rely on every day.\n\n“The speed of advancement in AI demands a different approach to how we build, how we organize, and where we focus. Labs gives us room to break the mold and explore,” said Daniela Amodei, President of Anthropic. “We now have the right structure in place to support the most critical motions for our product organization—discovering experimental products at the frontier of Claude’s capabilities, and scaling them responsibly to meet the needs of our enterprise customers and growing user base.”\n\nWe're hiring builders with a track record of creating products people love and shaping emerging technology with care. If you’d like to build with us at the very frontier of AI capabilities, [we want to hear from you](https://www.anthropic.com/careers).\n\nRelated content\n---------------\n\n### Introducing Claude Opus 4.6\n\nWe’re upgrading our smartest model. Across agentic coding, computer use, tool use, search, and finance, Opus 4.6 is an industry-leading model, often by wide margin.\n\n[Read more](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6)\n\n### Claude is a space to think\n\nWe’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. We explain why advertising incentives are incompatible with a genuinely helpful AI assistant, and how we plan to expand access without compromising user trust.\n\n[Read more](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think)\n\n### Apple’s Xcode now supports the Claude Agent SDK\n\n[Read more](https://www.anthropic.com/news/apple-xcode-claude-agent-sdk)\n"

What sort of tasks does AI support best? And how might it change the nature of people’s occupations?\n\nAt Anthropic, we’re measuring real-world AI use on an ongoing basis to answer questions exactly like these. Our privacy-preserving [analysis method](https://www.anthropic.com/research/clio) allows us to learn more about conversations on [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.e86f7f67-41dc-4399-b19b-4c2b4b605ac1) (capturing uses by consumers) and our first-party API (mostly capturing uses by businesses).1 In past reports, we’ve assessed AI tasks by [occupation and wage level](https://www.anthropic.com/news/the-anthropic-economic-index), looked more closely at [software development](https://www.anthropic.com/research/impact-software-development), and studied AI use [by country and by US state](https://www.anthropic.com/research/economic-index-geography).\n\nWe’re now adding a new level of detail to our Economic Index. In our fourth report, we’re introducing what we’ve called **economic primitives**: a set of five simple, foundational measurements to track the economic impacts of Claude over time. Our initial set includes task complexity, skill level, purpose (work, education, or personal use), AI autonomy, and success.2 We derive these primitives from asking Claude to answer a common set of questions about every conversation in our sample for this report.\n\nThese primitives provide a leading indicator of AI’s potential economic impacts—and allow us to answer far more complex questions about how AI is already changing jobs. Our latest report, which samples conversations from November 2025 (predominantly using Claude Sonnet 4.5), uses our primitives to explore a wide range of questions that we wouldn’t otherwise be able to answer—including how Claude’s task-level success rates change for more complex tasks, and whether the use of Claude to date might portend a net-deskilling effect on many jobs.\n\nYou can read the fourth Economic Index report [here](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-january-2026-report). Below, we summarize its results.\n\n**What we’ve learned from our economic primitives**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nWe applied our economic primitives to questions about individual tasks, occupations, and then the possible aggregate impacts of the changes we observe. (Our full methodology—including details on how we tested the accuracy of our primitives—is described in chapter two of the [full report](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-january-2026-report).)\n\n### Tasks\n\n#### **Which tasks does AI speed up, and by how much?**\n\nWe found that more complex tasks were sped up the most by Claude. We measure this by what Claude estimates as the number of years of schooling required to understand the conversation’s inputs: in Claude.ai, tasks with prompts requiring a high school education (12 years) were sped up by a factor of 9, while those requiring a college degree (16 years) were sped up by a factor of 12. (On the API, the speedup was greater still.) These results imply that AI’s productivity gains are currently accruing in tasks that require relatively high human capital, which is consistent with the [evidence](https://www.nber.org/papers/w32966) that white collar professionals are more likely to use AI at work.\n\nThis same trend holds—albeit in weaker form—when we adjust for tasks’ success rates. Claude successfully completes tasks that require a college degree 66% of the time, compared to 70% for those tasks that require less than a high school education. This reduces, but doesn’t eliminate, the overall effect: Claude’s impact on task speedup scales more sharply with complexity than complexity correlates with a decrease in success rate.\n\n![Image 1](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/images/4zrzovbb/website/748b522964169a031f15579194d8c8976ba80a79-1920x792.svg)\n\n_**Speedup and success rate vs. human years of schooling.**The chart on the left shows a scatterplot of the relationship between speedup and human years of schooling, measured at the O*NET task level. The dashed lines show the line of best fit. The chart on the right shows the relationship with the success rate._\n\n#### **What are the time horizons over which Claude can support tasks?**\n\n[METR](https://metr.org/)’s measure of AI’s [task horizons](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/) shows that longer tasks are harder for AI models to complete. But the length of time over which AI models can work is steadily increasing as models get better: this measure has now become a key indicator of AI progress.\n\nWe’re able to complement METR’s analysis using our economic primitives.

Keep thinking.\n\n![Image 6](https://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/2019063833256771584/img/hnwtE91waiTDif0q.jpg)\n\nClaude is built to be a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking. Advertising would be incompatible with that vision.

When advanced AI fails, will it do so by pursuing the wrong goals? Or will it fail unpredictably and incoherently—like a \"hot mess?\" Read more: [alignment.anthropic.com/2026/hot-mess-](https://t.co/xzRSoJg43j)\n\n[![Image 9: Square profile picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1798110641414443008/XP8gyBaY_normal.jpg)](https://x.com/AnthropicAI)\n\nIt also suggests that alignment work should focus more on reward hacking and goal misgeneralization during training, and less on preventing the relentless pursuit of a goal the model was not trained on.

The company was founded by former OpenAI employees, including siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, who departed due to differing views on AI safety and development direction [1, 2, 3]. Anthropic operates as a public-benefit corporation, with a stated mission to develop AI systems that are safe, reliable, interpretable, and beneficial to humanity. This commitment to safety is a core aspect of its corporate identity and research focus [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11].\n\nAnthropic has secured its position as a major player in the AI landscape through significant financial backing from major tech companies, including investments of up to $4 billion from Amazon and $2 billion from Google [1, 2, 3]. The company's primary products are the Claude chatbot and its family of large language models (LLMs), which include tiers such as Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku, each designed for varying levels of complexity and computational efficiency [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11]. To further its mission, Anthropic actively engages in AI safety research and has launched initiatives like \"Labs\" for incubating experimental products and the \"Economic Index\" to measure the real-world impact of its technology [5, 9, 10, 11].\n\n## Key Findings\n1.  **Founding and Mission:** Anthropic AI was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI staff who left over disagreements regarding AI safety.
